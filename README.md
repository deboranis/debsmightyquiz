# Debs's Mighty Quiz

<h3>This project was developed as en exercise for Ironhack's 1st module of the Fullstack Webdevelopeing Bootcamp.</h3>

<h3>Welcome to my Mighty Quiz! I decided to make this project as I remembered how lost I felt when I started studying front-end... those were trying times! :weary: I felt I would never grasp many of the concepts used for this very project, you see. Glad I was wrong! But maybe I can help you workout your brain a little, how about that? :wink: </h3>


<h3>For Debs's Mighty Quiz, I used:
<ul> 
<li>HTML</li>
<li>CSS</li>
<li>Vanilla Js</li>
</ul>
 Hope you like it! :purple_heart:
